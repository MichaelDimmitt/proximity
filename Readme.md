When to use proximity:

setup routines for your area.
<br/>recieve suggestions when different parts of the city.
<br/>recieve suggestions when in a new city.

suggestions are built from ... 
<br/>your list of things to do ... ie. taxes, oilchange, tirechange, job apply, 
<br/>call people, gym workout, laundry, grocery shopping, coffee shops, meetups,

... additionally we try to outsource to other apps as often as possible.


************************************PassOne************************************

proximity - an app that suggests activities when you are in an area.
<br/>archiving... this is a key feature of the application.

user: archive suggestion #2 vs dismiss, archive dismisses and archives a level further. 
<br/>there is also delete after repeated archives;

Each time you archive further it never deletes it instead moves one click further on the stack.
<br/>when everything is exhauseted ... we tried real hard but there was nothing to do in the area:

1) send feedback ... about some other thing to do. 
2) or click thanks for trying. And try again later.

This is how I have functioned my entire life.
<br/>I use an event like travelling to the northside to address all of my northside activities.

An app should not tell you someone is nearby and to message cold.
<br/>Instead it should ask would you be willing to reach out to this person.
<br/>And likewise ... it asks them would they be willing to reach out to you.

When both provide a yes the contact becomes warm.
<br/>When someone changes that preference the contact becomes cold again.
